<b><big><big>What Is Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?</big></big></b><br><br>
Doctors don't have a clear picture what IBS is or what causes it. But researchers do have a few theories:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp IBS sufferers may have a more sensitive <b>colon</b> than others.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp In people with IBS, the <b>brain</b> may perceive <b>contractions</b> in the gut more acutely than others.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp The immune system may respond differently to stress and infection in people with IBS.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Hormonal changes may trigger <b>IBS symptoms</b> (70% of those who suffer from IBS are women).<br><br>
Basically, IBS is a collection of symptoms that has been ongoing for at least 6 months, and has occurred at least 3 times a month in the past 3 months. IBS always involves abdominal pain or discomfort.<br><br>
If you think you may have IBS, see your doctor for proper diagnosis and care. Depending on the type of IBS that you have, there are various treatment options, including dietary changes, <b>stress management</b>, <b>medication</b>, behavioral therapy, and alternative treatments.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Types of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</big></big></b><br><br>
There are three types of <b>irritable bowel syndrome</b>, or IBS. They include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>IBS with constipation.</b> This comes with <b>stomach pain</b> and discomfort, <b>bloating</b>, abnormally delayed or infrequent <b>bowel movement</b>, or lumpy/hard stool.<br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>IBS with diarrhea.</b> This comes with stomach pain and discomfort, an urgent need to move your bowels, abnormally frequent <b>bowel movements</b>, or loose/watery stool.<br>
&#149;&nbsp IBS with alternating <b>constipation</b> and <b>diarrhea</b>.<br><br>
There are about an equal number of people with IBS in each category. There is also evidence that most people with IBS will alternate between types over time.<br><br>
This all makes it difficult for researchers to find a single drug treatment that will relieve all the <b>symptoms of IBS</b>. Different <b>medications</b> work for <b>IBS with constipation</b> and for <b>IBS with diarrhea</b>. Doctors will usually tailor an individual treatment regimen for people who have IBS with alternating symptoms.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Symptoms</big></big></b><br><br>
We all have stomachaches and trouble going to the bathroom once in a while, but for people with <b>IBS</b>, the <b>chronic pain</b> and discomfort can be disabling.<br><br>
Along with abdominal cramping and discomfort, <b>IBS symptoms</b> may include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Bloating<br>
&#149;&nbsp  Gas<br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>Constipation</b> - the stool comes out either lumpy or hard<br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>Diarrhea</b> - the stool comes out loose or watery<br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>Bowel movements</b> that feel uncontrollably urgent, difficult to pass, or incomplete<br><br>
<b><big><big>IBS Triggers and How to Avoid Them</big></big></b><br><br>
When you know the things that can make your IBS symptoms flare up, called triggers, you can make a plan to avoid them. That way, you can work on keeping problems with constipation, diarrhea, belly pain, and bloating to a minimum.<br><br>
IBS is different for everyone, but it may help to keep track of how you react to the most common symptom triggers and learn to prevent them.<br><br>
<b><big>1. Diet Triggers for IBS Constipation</big></b><br>
Some <b>foods can make IBS-related constipation</b> worse, including:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Breads and cereals made with refined (not whole) grains<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Processed foods such as chips and cookies<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Coffee, carbonated drinks, and alcohol<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Dairy products, especially cheese<br><br><br>
<b><big>2. Diet Triggers for IBS Diarrhea</big></b><br><br>
<b>Foods that can make IBS-related diarrhea</b> worse for some people include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Too much fiber, especially the insoluble kind you get in the <b>skin of fruits and vegetables</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Food and drinks with <b>chocolate</b>, alcohol, <b>caffeine</b>, fructose, or sorbitol<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Carbonated drinks<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Large meals<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Dairy products, especially in people who can’t digest the milk sugar lactose, called <b>lactose intolerance</b><br><br>
<b><big>3. Stress and Anxiety Triggers for IBS</big></b><br><br>
<b>Stress and anxiety</b> can make <b>IBS symptoms</b> worse. Worries can come from a lot of sources, including:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Work<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  Your commute<br>
&#149;&nbsp  Problems at home<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  A sense that things are out of your control<br><br>
<b><big><big>Who Is at Risk for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?</big></big></b><br><br>
Doctors don’t know for sure what causes irritable bowel syndrome, but some things seem to make people more likely to have it than others. These risk factors for IBS include:<br><br>
<b>Being a woman.</b> About twice as many women as men have the condition. It’s not clear why, but some researchers think the changing hormones in the menstrual cycle may have something to do with it.<br><br>
<b>Age.</b> IBS can affect people of all ages, but it's more likely for people in their teens through their 40s.<br><br>
<b>Family history.</b> The condition seems to run in families. Some studies have shown that your genes may play a role.<br><br>
<b>Emotional trouble.</b> Some people with IBS seem to have trouble with stress, have a mental disorder, or have been through a traumatic event in their lives, such as sexual abuse or domestic violence.<br><br>
<b>Medications.</b> Studies have shown a link between IBS symptoms and antibiotics, antidepressants, and drugs made with sorbitol.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Alternative Treatments</big></big></b><br><br>
Alternative treatments such as <b>acupuncture</b>, <b>dietary supplements</b>, and herbs don't always get the official scientific nod, but some patients turn to them for help with <b>irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</b>.<br><br>
<b><big>Acupuncture for IBS</big></b><br><br>
<b>Acupuncture</b> is a popular alternative therapy for <b>IBS</b> and other conditions. It's proven effective for treating <b>chronic pain</b>, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, the studies are mixed on whether this treatment really works for IBS.<br><br>
<b><big>Oils and Supplements for IBS</big></b><br><br>
To help her IBS patients, Blackman recommends a combination of treatments, including <b>changes in diet</b>, <b>stress reduction</b>, and supplements such as <b>evening primrose oil</b>, borage oil, <b>fish oil</b>, or <b>probiotics</b>. She says the oil supplements help calm down the gut, and probiotics restore the good balance of bacteria in the <b>digestive system</b>.<br><br>
Fish oil supplements have been examined along with fish for a number of benefits, including preventing <b>heart disease</b> and easing <b>autoimmune disorders</b>. There doesn't appear to be any scientific proof, however, that they work for IBS.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Complications From IBS: What Can Happen?</big></big></b><br><br>
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 45 million Americans. But doctors don't know a lot about what causes this gut disorder. Finding a treatment that works can take time, and other health problems can crop up in the meantime.<br><br>
None of the complications are life-threatening, though. IBS doesn't lead to cancer or other more serious bowel-related conditions. Here are some of the health issues it can cause:<br><br>
<b>Dehydration</b>: If you have severe diarrhea often, your body can lose too much water and salt. That can make you dehydrated. You can keep this from happening by drinking plenty of water. Your doctor may recommend fruit juice and sports drinks as well.<br><br>
<b>Impacted bowel</b>: If you're constipated for a long time, stool can get blocked in your colon. Sometimes it can get so hard that you can't push it out. This is known as a fecal impaction. It can hurt and cause things like headache, nausea, and vomiting. It happens most often with older adults. See your doctor right away if you have signs this may be happening.<br><br>
<b>Food intolerance</b>: Certain foods can make your IBS symptoms worse. What they are can be different for everyone. But some people feel better when they cut out wheat, dairy, coffee, eggs, yeast, potatoes, and citrus fruits. And fats and sugars can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may suggest you try a FODMAP diet to cut out some carbohydrates that are hard to digest.<br><br>
<b>Malnourishment</b>: Cutting back on some types of foods can ease your IBS symptoms. But your body may not get all the nutrients it needs. A dietitian can help you find a diet that works for you.<br><br>
