# microDoctor

## Pretty Short Intro
Basic concept that evolved this app is **Symptom Analysis**. Take an instance where you don't have time to go to your doctor (since we are so busy) and want to diagnose yourself. Voila! That's exactly the idea behind this. Using disease data and what their causes are, makes it identify what exactly could your problem be.

**Features:**
1. **Symptom Analysis**
2. Trending Diseases
3. Locating nearby Chemists within the app.
4. Disease description, causes, medical remedies, home remedies, treatments and so on.
5. Integration with 1mg(Online medicine ordering app) to directly connect with the Search Activity of 1mg.
6. Feedback System
7. **Firebase Realtime Database**
8. **Dynamic Data** i.e. certain elements can be added or removed from the database and the interface will reflect changes instantaneously.
