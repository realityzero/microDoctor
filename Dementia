<b><big><big>What is dementia?</big></big></b><br><br>
We all forget things as we get older. Many older people have a slight loss of memory that does not affect their daily lives. But <b>memory loss</b> that gets worse may mean that you have dementia.<br><br>
Dementia is a loss of mental skills that affects your daily life. It can cause problems with your memory and how well you can think and plan. Usually dementia gets worse over time. How long this takes is different for each person. Some people stay the same for years. Others lose skills quickly.<br><br>
Your chances of having dementia rise as you get older. But this doesn't mean that everyone will get it.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Cause</big></big></b><br><br>
<b>Dementia</b> is caused by damage to or changes in the <b>brain</b>. <b>Alzheimer's disease</b> is the most common cause. <>bStroke</b> is the second most common cause of dementia. Dementia caused by <b>stroke</b> is called <b>vascular dementia</b>.<br><br>
Some causes of dementia can be reversed with treatment, but most cannot.<br><br>
<b>Causes that cannot be reversed</b><br><br>
Common causes of dementia that cannot be reversed are:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Parkinson's disease</b>. Dementia is common in people with this condition.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Dementia with Lewy bodies</b>. It can cause short-term <b>memory loss</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Frontotemporal dementia</b>, a group of diseases that includes <b>Pick's disease</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Severe <b>head injury</b> that caused a loss of consciousness.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Vascular dementia</b> that may occur in people who have a <b>stroke</b>, long-term <b>high blood pressure</b>, or severe hardening of the <b>arteries</b> (<b>atherosclerosis</b>).<br><br>
<b><big><big>Symptoms</big></big></b><br><br>
Symptoms of <b>dementia</b> vary depending on the cause and the <b>area of the brain</b> that is affected. Symptoms include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Memory loss</b>. This is usually the earliest and most noticeable symptom.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Trouble controlling moods or behaviors. <b>Depression</b> is common, and agitation or aggression may occur.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Trouble finding the right words.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Trouble <b>exercising judgment</b>, such as knowing what to do in an emergency.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Exams and Tests</big></big></b><br><br>
<b>Mental status exam</b><br><br>
A doctor or other health professional will conduct a <b>mental status exam</b>. This test usually involves such activities as having the person tell what day and year it is, repeat a series of words, draw a clock face, and count back from 100 by 7s.<br><br>
Other tests have been developed to diagnose dementia. Doctors can use one such test, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, to distinguish <b>Alzheimer's disease</b> from frontotemporal dementia. Orientation, attention, and memory are worse in <b>Alzheimer's</b>, while language skills and ability to name objects are worse in frontotemporal dementia.<br><br>
<b>Lab tests</b><br><br>
Many medical conditions can cause mental impairment. During a physical exam, the doctor will look for signs of other medical conditions and have lab tests done to find any treatable condition. Routine tests include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Thyroid hormone tests</b> to check for an underactive <b>thyroid</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Vitamin B12 blood test</b> to look for a vitamin deficiency.<br><br>
<b>Imaging tests</b><br><br>
<b>Brain</b> imaging tests such as <b>CT scans</b> and <b>MRI</b> may also be done to make sure another problem isn't causing the symptoms. These tests may rule out <b>brain tumors</b>, strokes, <b>normal-pressure hydrocephalus</b>, or other conditions that could cause <b>dementia symptoms</b>.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Treatment Overview</big></big></b><br><br>
Some cases of <b>dementia</b> are caused by medical conditions that can be treated, and treatment can restore some or all mental function. But most of the time, dementia cannot be reversed.<br><br>
<b>Treatment when dementia can be reversed</b><br><br>
Sometimes treating the cause of dementia helps the dementia. For example, the person might:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Take <b>vitamins</b> for a deficiency of <b>vitamin B12</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Have surgery to remove a <b>brain tumor</b> or to reduce pressure on the <b>brain</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Take medicines to treat an infection, such as <b>encephalitis</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Take medicine to treat <b>depression</b>.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Stop or change medicines that are causing <b>memory loss</b> or confusion.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Prevention</big></big></b><br><br>
<b>Dementia</b> is hard to prevent, because what causes it often is not known. But people who have dementia caused by <b>stroke</b> may be able to prevent future declines by lowering their risk of <b>heart disease</b> and <b>stroke</b>. Even if you don't have these known risks, your overall health can benefit from these strategies:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Don't smoke.</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Stay at a healthy weight.</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Get plenty of exercise. </b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Eat healthy food.</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Manage health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Stay mentally alert</b> by learning new hobbies, reading, or solving crossword puzzles. <br><br>
<b><big><big>Home Treatment</big></big></b><br><br>
Home treatment for <b>dementia</b> involves teamwork among health professionals and caregivers to create a safe and comfortable environment and to make tasks of daily living as easy as possible. People who have mild dementia can be involved in planning for the future and organizing the home and daily tasks.<br><br>
<b>Tips for caregivers</b><br><br>
Work with the team of health professionals to:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Make sure your home is safe.<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Keep the person eating well. <br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Manage bladder and bowel control problems. <br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Manage driving privileges.<br><br>
<b>Nursing home placement</b><br><br>
Even with the best care, a person with progressive dementia will decline, perhaps to the point where the caregiver is no longer physically, emotionally, or financially able to provide care.<br><br>
Making the decision about nursing home placement is often very difficult. Every family needs to consider its own financial situation, emotional capacity, and other issues.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Medications</big></big></b><br><br>
<b><big>Medicine choices</big></b><br><br>
<b>Medicines to help maintain mental function</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Cholinesterase inhibitors such as <b>donepezil</b>, galantamine, and <b>rivastigmine</b>.
&#149;&nbsp Memantine. This medicine is used to treat <b>symptoms of Alzheimer's disease</b>, but may also help with mild to moderate vascular dementia.<br><br>
<b><big>Medicines to help control mood or behavior problems</big></b><br><br>
In some cases, the doctor may prescribe:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Antipsychotic drugs</b>, such as olanzapine (Zyprexa) and risperidone (Risperdal).<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp  <b>Antidepressants</b> , especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.<br><br>
<b><big>Medicines to prevent future strokes</big></b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp The doctor may prescribe medicines for <b>high blood pressure</b> and <b>high cholesterol</b>, since these conditions are risk factors for vascular dementia. These drugs can't reverse existing dementia, but they may prevent future strokes and <b>heart disease</b> that can lead to further <b>brain damage</b>.<br>
