<b><big><big>What are migraine symptoms?</big></big></b><br><br>
A migraine isn’t just an <b>average headache</b>. Migraines are <b>strong</b>, pounding headaches typically on one side of the head.<br><br>
Migraines usually include several other symptoms. They’re sometimes preceded by <b>warning symptoms</b> called <b>aura</b>. These symptoms may include flashes of light, visual “floaters,” or tingling sensations in your arms and legs.<br><br>
The <b>classic migraine</b> evolves through <b>four separate stage</b>. Each stage has different symptoms. These stages include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp the prodrome (premonitory) stage<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp the aura (visual symptoms or tingling)<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp the headache (main attack) stage<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp the postdrome (recovery) stage<br><br>
Not all people who get migraines experience all of the stages.<br><br>
<b><big>Prodrome stage</big></b><br><br>
The <b>premonitory or prodrome stage</b> can start anywhere from <b>one hour to two days</b> before your migraine begins. Symptoms that may indicate that a migraine is coming on include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp fatigue<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp mood changes, such as anxiety or depression<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp thirst<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp craving for sugary foods<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp tight or sore neck<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp constipation<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp irritability<br><br>
<b><big>Aura stage</big></b><br><br>
The aura stage happens right <b>before or during a migraine</b>. Auras are usually <b>visual disturbances</b>, but can involve other sensations. Symptoms build up gradually and last for about <b>20 to 60 minutes</b>. About 30 percent of people who experience migraine have migraine with aura.<br><br>
Symptoms of an aura can include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp seeing bright spots or flashes of light <br><br>
&#149;&nbsp vision loss or seeing dark spots<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp tingling sensations in an arm or leg described as “pins and needles”<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp speech problems or inability to speak (aphasia)<br><br>
<b><big>Main attack stage</big></b><br><br>
The attack stage includes the headache and other symptoms. It can last for a few hours to a few days.<br><br>
During an attack, you might experience the following symptoms:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp pulsating or throbbing pain on one or both sides of the head<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp extreme sensitivity to light, sounds, or smells<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp worsening pain during physical activity<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp nausea and vomiting<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp abdominal pain or heartburn<br><br>
If you have a migraine, you’ll often feel the need to lie down in the dark and quiet to escape from light, sounds, and movement. This is one of the main differences between migraines and other types of headaches. Fortunately, you may find that sleeping for an hour or two can help end an attack.<br><br>
<b><big>Recovery stage</big></b><br><br>
During the recovery (postdrome) stage, you may feel tired and drained. The migraine fades slowly. Some people report feelings of euphoria.<br><br>
<b><big>Migraines vs. tension headaches</big></b><br><br>
Tension headaches and migraines may cause very similar symptoms. Migraine symptoms tend to be more severe than tension headaches.<br><br>
With a tension headache, your pain is usually mild to moderate throughout your head, and disappears within a few hours. Migraines tend to last longer and are often debilitating.<br><br>
Tension headaches don’t typically cause any visual side effects like aura or physical side effects like nausea or vomiting. Tension headaches can make you feel sensitive to light or sound but usually not both. <br><br>
Sinus headaches are often confused for migraines because they share many symptoms, including pressure in the sinuses and watery eyes. Sinus headaches are usually only moderately painful and can be treated with sinus treatments or other allergy medications.<br><br>
<b><big>Relief and treatment</big></b><br><br>
Medications for pain relief may be enough to treat your symptoms. Common pain relievers that can help migraine symptoms include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp ibuprofen<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp aspirin<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp acetaminophen (Tylenol)<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Excedrin (aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine)<br><br>
If your pain continues, talk to your doctor about other treatment options. <br><br>
<b><big>Migraine prevention</big></b><br><br>
If you have at least six migraines per month or three migraines a month that severely interfere with your daily life, your doctor may recommend preventive medications that are effective against migraine symptoms, including:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp beta-blockers, such as propranolol or timolol, for high blood pressure or coronary diseases<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, for high blood pressure<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, for controlling serotonin and other chemicals in your brain<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp antiseizure drugs, such as valproate (in moderate doses)<br><br>
There can be side effects of these medications. Also, talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes that can help decrease migraines. Things like quitting smoking, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding triggers from certain foods, and staying hydrated can be useful.<br><br>
