Fever is usually associated with physical discomfort, and most people feel better when a fever is treated. But depending on your age, physical condition, and the underlying cause of your fever, you may or may not require medical treatment for the fever alone. Many experts believe that fever is a natural bodily defense against infection. There are also many non-infectious causes of fever.<br><br>
Fever is generally not considered dangerous, but hyperthermia can cause dangerous <b>rises in body temperature</b>. This can be due to an extreme temperature associated with heat injury such as <b>heat stroke</b>, side effects of certain <b>medications</b> or illicit drugs, and <b>stroke</b>. With hyperthermia, the body is no longer able to control body temperature.<br><br>
In children with fever, accompanying symptoms such as lethargy, fussiness, poor appetite, <b>sore throat, cough, ear pain, vomiting, and diarrhea</b> are important to relay to your doctor.<br><br>
<b>Call your doctor right away</b> if your child has a fever and:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Looks very sick<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Is drowsy or very fussy<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Has a weakened immune system or other medical problems<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Has other symptoms such as rash, sore throat, headache, stiff neck, or earache<br><br>
Call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 1 day in a child less than 2 years old or lasts more than 3 days in a child age 2 or older.<br><br>
<b><big>Causes of Fever</big></b><br><br>
A part of the <b>brain</b> called the hypothalamus controls body temperature, which usually varies throughout the day from the normal temperature of 98.6 F.<br><br>
In response to an infection, illness, or some other cause, the hypothalamus may reset the body to a higher temperature.<br><br>
Although the most common causes of fever are common infections such as <b>colds</b> and gastroenteritis, other causes include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Infections of the ear, <b>lung</b>, <b>skin</b>, throat, </b>bladder</b>, or kidney<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Conditions that cause <b>inflammation</b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Cancer<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Vaccines<br><br>
<b><big>Diagnosis of Fever</big></b><br><br>
Although a fever is easy to measure, determining its cause can be hard. Besides a <b>physical exam</b>, your doctor will ask about symptoms and conditions, <b>medications</b>, and if you've recently traveled to areas with infections or have other infection risks. A <b>malaria infection</b>, for example, may be have a fever that typically recurs.<br><br>
Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." In such cases, the cause could be an unusual or not obvious condition such as a chronic infection, a connective tissue disorder, cancer, or another problem.<br><br>
<b><big>Treatments for Fever</big></b><br><br>
Treatments vary depending on the cause of the fever. For example, <b>antibiotics</b> would be used for a <b>bacterial infection</b> such as <b>strep throat</b>.<br><br>
The most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as <b>acetaminophen (Tylenol)</b> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such <b>ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)</b> and naproxen (Aleve).<br><br>
