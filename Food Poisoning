<b><big><big>What is food poisoning?</big></big></b><br><br>Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating foods that have harmful organisms in them. These harmful germs can include bacteria, parasites, and viruses. They are mostly found in raw meat, chicken, fish, and eggs, but they can spread to any type of food. They can also grow on food that is left out on counters or outdoors or is stored too long before you eat it. Sometimes food poisoning happens when people don't wash their hands before they touch food.<br><br>Most of the time, food poisoning is mild and goes away after a few days. All you can do is wait for your body to get rid of the germ that is causing the illness. But some types of food poisoning may be more serious, and you may need to see a doctor.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Cause</big></big></b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp<b>During food processing. </b>It is normal to find bacteria in the intestines of healthy animals that we use for food. If bacteria come in contact with meat or poultry during processing, they can contaminate the food.<br>
&#149;&nbsp<b>During food growing. </b>Fresh fruits and vegetables can be contaminated if they are washed or irrigated with water that is contaminated with animal manure or human sewage.<br>
&#149;&nbsp<b>During food handling. </b>Food can be contaminated when an infected person handles the food or if it comes in contact with another contaminated product.<br>
&#149;&nbsp<b>Through the environment. </b>Many harmful organisms that are commonly found in dirt, dust, and water can find their way into the foods we eat.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Symptoms</big></big></b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Diarrhea<br>
&#149;&nbsp Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea)<br>
&#149;&nbsp Vomiting<br>
&#149;&nbsp Abdominal (belly) cramps<br><br>
<b><big><big>Exams and Tests</big></big></b><br><br>
Most food poisoning is mild and passes in a few days, so most people don't go to a doctor for a diagnosis. You can often diagnose food poisoning yourself if others who ate the same food as you also become ill.<br><br>
If you do go to your doctor, he or she will make the diagnosis based on your symptoms, a physical exam, and your medical history. Your doctor will ask where you have been eating and whether anyone who ate the same food has the same symptoms.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Treatment Overview</big></big></b><br><br>
In most cases, the diarrhea and other symptoms of food poisoning go away in 2 to 3 days, and you don't need treatment. It may be longer than 2 to 3 days until you feel normal again.<br><br>
All you have to do is manage symptoms, especially diarrhea, and avoid complications until the illness passes. In most cases, dehydration caused by diarrhea is the main complication.<br><br>
The goal of treatment is to replace fluids and electrolytes lost through vomiting and diarrhea. If dehydration is severe and can't be managed at home, you may need treatment in the hospital, where fluids and electrolytes may be given to you by inserting a needle into your vein.<br><br>
Medicines that stop diarrhea (such as <b>Imodium</b>) can help with your symptoms. But these medicines shouldn't be used in children or in people with a high fever or bloody diarrhea. Antibiotics are rarely used and only for certain types of food poisoning or in severe cases.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Prevention</big></big></b><br><br>
You can prevent most cases of food poisoning by being careful when you prepare and store food. Wash your hands and working surfaces while preparing food, cook foods to safe temperatures, and refrigerate foods promptly. Be especially careful when you cook or heat perishable foods, such as eggs, meats, poultry, fish, shellfish, milk, and milk products. Also take extra care if you are pregnant, have an impaired immune system, or are preparing foods for children or older people.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Home Treatment</big></big></b><br><br>
Most cases of food poisoning will go away in a few days with rest and care at home. The following information will help you recover.<br><br>
<b>Prevent dehydration</b><br>
Dehydration is the most frequent complication of food poisoning. Older persons and children should take special precautions to prevent it.<br><br>
To prevent dehydration, take frequent sips of a rehydration drink. Try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool you have. Sports drinks, soda pop, and fruit juices contain too much sugar and not enough of the important electrolytes that are lost during diarrhea, so they shouldn't be used to rehydrate. You can make your own rehydration drink.<br><br>
Try to stay with your normal diet as much as possible. Eating your usual diet will help you to get enough nutrition.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Medications</big></big></b><br><br>
Medicines aren't used routinely in food poisoning. Medicines that stop diarrhea (antidiarrheals) can help with your symptoms. These medicines (such as <b>Imodium</b>) shouldn't be used if you have a fever or bloody diarrhea, because they can actually make you sicker. Don't give antidiarrheals to children.<br><br>
<b>Types of food poisoning</b> that may be treated with medicines include:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Botulism</b>, which usually requires the botulism antitoxin and close medical care.<br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Listeriosis</b>, which in <b>pregnant</b> women is treated with antibiotics to prevent infection of the fetus or newborn. Babies with listeriosis may also receive antibiotics.<br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Toxoplasmosis food poisoning</b>, which in pregnant women is treated with antibiotics.<br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Shigellosis</b>, which may be treated with antibiotics. But some types of Shigella bacteria aren't killed by antibiotics. This is called resistance. Because using antibiotics can make these bacteria even more resistant, mild cases of shigellosis aren't usually treated with antibiotics.<br>
