<b><big><big>What Is an Ear Infection?</big></big></b><br><br>
An ear infection, or <b>otitis media</b>, is the most common cause of <b>earaches</b>. Although this condition is a frequent cause of <b>infant</b> distress and is often associated with children, it can also affect adults.<br><br>
The infection in the middle ear (the space behind the eardrum where tiny bones pick up vibrations and pass them along to the inner ear) very often accompanies a <b>common cold</b>, the <b>flu</b>, or other types of respiratory infections. This is because the middle ear is connected to the upper respiratory tract by a tiny channel known as the Eustachian tube. Germs that are growing in the nose or <b>sinus</b> cavities can climb up the Eustachian tube and enter the middle ear to start growing.<br><br>
<b><big><big>What Causes an Ear Infection?</big></big></b><br><br>
The middle ear is a small space behind the ear drum that is supposed to be well ventilated by air that normally passes up from behind the nose, through the Eustachian tube, keeping the middle ear clean and dry. When there is not enough fresh air ventilating the middle ear, such as when the Eustachian tube is clogged or blocked, the area becomes damp, stagnant, and warm, a perfect breeding ground for germs.<br><br>
In children and infants, the Eustachian tube is often too soft or immature and has a harder time staying open. <b>Allergies</b>, post nasal drainage, <b>sinus</b> infections, <b>common cold</b> virusesand <b>adenoid</b> problems can all interfere with the Eustachian tube’s ability to let air pass into the middle ear.<br><br>
When the doctor looks at the ear drum, he or she will see that it is red, often bulging, and be able to make the diagnosis of an ear infection.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Symptoms</big></big></b><br><br>
<b><big>What Are the Symptoms of an Ear Infection?</big></b><br><br>
The symptoms of an <b>ear infection</b> in adults are:<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Earache</b> (either a sharp, sudden pain or a dull, continuous pain)<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp A sharp stabbing pain with immediate warm drainage from the ear canal<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp A feeling of fullness in the ear<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Nausea<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Ear drainage<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Muffled hearing<br><br>
In children, the symptoms are:<br>
&#149;&nbsp Tugging at the ear<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Poor sleep<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Fever<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Irritability, restlessness<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp Ear drainage<br><br>
<b><big><big>Call Your Doctor About an Ear Infection If:</big></big></b><br><br>
&#149;&nbsp <b>Body temperature</b> rises above 100.4 degrees; a fever signals the possibility of a more serious infection (especially in infants and young children)<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp You or your child frequently develops <b>ear infections</b>; repeated bouts with the disorder can lead to <b>hearing loss</b> or more serious infections<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp You or your child has hearing problems; the infection may be the cause<br><br>
&#149;&nbsp You suspect that your young child has an ear infection<br><br>
<b><big><big>Ear Infection Prevention</big></big></b><br><br>
If you watch over a young child, you probably know how common <b>earaches</b> can be.<br><br>
Adults get them, too, but kids usually get them more often because they haven’t built up their immune systems to fight off common viruses and bacteria yet.<br><br>
You can’t always stop all <b>ear infections</b>. But you can learn what causes them and then take steps to lower the chances that you or a child in your care will get them.<br><br>
<b><big>How They Happen</big></b><br><br>
You get these infections in your <b>middle ear</b>. It’s an air-filled space behind your eardrum. It holds tiny, vibrating bones that pick up sound waves so you can hear.<br><br>
A <b>cold, the flu</b>, or even <b>allergies</b> can all bring one on, too. That’s because they tend to cause congestion and swelling in your nasal passages and throat. When fluid builds up, it can increase your chance of an <b>ear infection</b>.<br><br>
<b><big>Risks</big></b><br><br>
Ear infections tend to occur more in fall and winter because upper-respiratory infections such as <b>cold and flu</b> are on the rise then, too. Children who are 2 and younger get more <b>ear infections</b> because of the small size and shape of their Eustachian tubes.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Treatments</big></big></b><br><br>
<b><big>Pain Relief</big></b><br><br>
If a virus is causing the infection and you have to wait for it to get better, you don’t need to live with the <b>pain</b>.<br><br>
<b><big>Antibiotics</big></b><br><br>
If your doctor decides to go with antibiotics, follow all the instructions. Take all of the doses even if you or your child are feeling better. Call your doctor or pharmacist if you skip a dose or feel sick from the medicine.<br><br>
If you don’t take the whole course, your infection could come back and become resistant to more treatments.<br><br>
<b><big>Drainage</big></b><br><br>
If an infection causes serious complications, fluid remains in the ear for a long time, or your child has <b>ear infections</b> that keep coming back, your doctor might want to do a procedure called a myringotomy.<br><br>
<b><big>Natural Remedies</big></b><br><br>
You can do things at home to ease your symptoms. Talk to your doctor first about these tips:<br><br>
<b>Warmth</b>: You may find a heated compress brings comfort.<br><br>
<b>Feedings</b>: If you feed your baby with a bottle, do it standing up. Don’t put your infant to bed with one. Try to take your child off it as soon as the doctor thinks he’s ready.<br><br>
<b>Gargling</b>: In older children or adults, <b>salt water</b> helps soothe a raw throat and may help clear the Eustachian tubes.<br><br>
<b>Stand tall</b>: Holding your head erect can help drain your middle ear.<br><br>
<b>Fresh air</b>: Smokers should refrain from smoking inside the house or anywhere near your child.<br><br>
<b><big><big>Home Treatments</big></big></b><br><br>
<b>A cool or warm compress</b>. Soak a washcloth in either cool or warm water, wring it out, and then put it over the ear that's bothering you. Try both temperatures to see if one helps you more than the other.<br><br>
<b>Olive oil drops</b>. While there’s no scientific evidence that proves this treatment works, the American Academy of Pediatrics says it could be moderately effective on ear pain. Put a few drops of warm olive oil in the ear that's giving you trouble, like you would use ear drops.<br><br>
<b>Try a pain reliever</b>. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen can often relieve the pain of an earache. Ask your doctor which is right for you.<br><br>
<b>Chew gum</b>. If you’re on an airplane or driving at high altitudes and your ear pain is from the change in air pressure, chew some gum. It can help lower that pressure and ease your symptoms.<br><br>
<b>Sleep upright</b>. While it may sound strange, resting or sleeping sitting up rather than lying down can encourage fluid in your ear to drain. This could ease pressure and pain in your middle ear. Prop yourself up in bed with a stack of pillows, or sleep in an armchair that’s a bit reclined.<br><br>
